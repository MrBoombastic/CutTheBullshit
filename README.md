# Cut The Bullshit

<img src="./src/logo.webp" alt="Description" width="300">

Simple tools to help you cut the bullshit out of your life. No ads, no begging, no flashy stuff, just do your fucking
job.

## Available tools

1. All Status Pages - quickly check the status of most of the web services, like cloud providers, "serverless" services,
   etc.
2. Email Mockup - create an email mockup, suitable for slideshows, for example
3. Universal WHOIS and RDAP - check information about the domain

## Notice

These tools are designed to work without the need of server. That's why they are sometimes calling external, 3rd party
services. You may or may not be fine with that.

If you have any suggestions, please file an issue or a pull request. Help me cut the bullshit.
